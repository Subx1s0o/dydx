# Errors

## NewlyUndercollateralized

**Description**: Stateful order collateralization check failed.

**Details**: This error occurs when an account has insufficient collateral to cover its positions or obligations. The account's collateral value has fallen below the required threshold to maintain its current positions, potentially due to market movements, increased leverage, or reduced collateral value.

To resolve this issue, users need to either add more collateral/balance to their account or reduce their position size to meet the required collateralization ratio.
